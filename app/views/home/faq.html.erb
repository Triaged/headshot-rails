            	<h5>How do Badge mobile messages work?</h5>
            	<p>It's easy - they're just like text messages, but they go to the Badge app, rather than your text message app.  When you message someone, they'll get a notification, and they'll be able to swipe to reply immediately.</p>
            	</br>
            	<h5>Do Badge mobile messages use cellular data on my plan?</h5>
            	<p>If you're on Wifi, Badge sends messages over Wifi. If you aren't on Wifi, then the messages do use cellular data.However, Badge messages are text-only - so you'd need to send millions to consume even 1MB of data.</p>
            	</br>
            	<h5>Do Badge mobile messages count against my text message limit on my plan?</h5>
            	<p>Nope, not at all.</p>
            	</br>
            	<h5>Can I send group messages?</h5>
            	<p>Yes! Just create a new message, and select the recipients you'd like to include.</p>
